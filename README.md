### Technology used on this project

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React functional components, React hooks (UseState and UseEffect) and Material UI.

### Reflection
This was a 2 week long project during my pre-course for Intensive Frontend course by  Novare Potential.
I have used Materials UI to get the pre-build Header, form and button elements. There are mainly five react functional components (App, Header, TodoForm, TodoList and Todo) in this project. Among them App is the main component and I have rendered other components like Header, TodoForm and TodoList inside App component. I have reused TodoList components twice to view the list items and completed list items. I have used the UseState hook to track the dynamics state of our App.  I have also used the useEffect hook to retrieve and store data from  local storage of the  browser
